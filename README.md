### What I learned

After a period of inactivity, this project helped me to refresh my knowledge and identify areas for improvement, particularly in terms of best practices (CSS rules, orders, structures, hierarchy, etc.). While there may be a few errors, I am confident that I can use these to facilitate my learning and resolve them as I enhance my coding abilities.

### Continued development

I need to improve my responsive theory and practice, the use of rules like *width*, *max-width*, *min-width*, and *height* respectively.
